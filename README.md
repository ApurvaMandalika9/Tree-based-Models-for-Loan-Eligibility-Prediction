# Tree-based-Models-for-Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

- In part A, created a decision tree as a binary classifier
Steps :
1. Data Processing and EDA
2. Implementation
   - Using the data pre-processed above, implemented a classification tree from scratch for prediction.
   - Built the tree model using training data and Gini Index as the splitting criteria. Validated the trained model with validation data and conducted inference on the test data.
     
- In part B, use a decisiontree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm - XGBoost
Steps :
1. Implemented an XGBoost model with L2 regularization.
2. Training and Hyperparameter tuning.
3. Tested the model with the best parameters.
4. ROC curve for the XGBoost model on validation data

- Compared the validation result obtained using XGBoost with the results using the tree implemented in part A.
